/* 
INSTRUCTIONS: Replace Profile Image

To add your new profile image from the attachment:

1. Save the second image (the professional photo in the auditorium) as:
   c:\isma portfolio\assets\profile.jpg

2. The image should be cropped to approximately square format (1:1 ratio)
3. Recommended size: 400x400 pixels for best quality
4. The website will automatically use the new image

Current setup:
- The HTML already references: assets/profile.jpg
- The CSS styling will automatically apply: circular crop, border, hover effects
- No code changes needed once you save the image file

Your new professional photo will look great with the existing styling!
