// Instructions to replace the profile image placeholder with your actual image

/*
IMPORTANT: To add your profile image, follow these steps:

1. Save your uploaded profile image as 'profile.jpg' in the 'assets' folder
2. Make sure the image is approximately 400x400 pixels for best results
3. The image should be in JPG, PNG, or WebP format

Current image path: assets/profile.jpg

The HTML already references this path, so once you save your image as:
c:\isma portfolio\assets\profile.jpg

It will automatically appear on your website.

Your uploaded image shows a professional headshot with:
- Blue/teal background
- Professional attire
- Good lighting and composition
- Circular crop-friendly composition

This will work perfectly with the existing styling!
